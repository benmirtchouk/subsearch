Did he show you the shadows
beyond the northern borders?

00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:53,336
No. He said I can't go there.
Ever.

- Watering hole.

There's no hyenas.
You just chased them all off.

244
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:25,293
Just to the watering hole
and no further.

245
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:28,539
And stay downwind.

246
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,573
And one more little thing.

247
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:32,540

or you don't.

00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:49,594
You hate the water.

255
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:51,923
I heard about this place, Nala.

256
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:53,556
The most incredible, amazing...

257
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:55,428
Just tell me where.

258
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:58,399
An elephant graveyard.

259
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:00,662
Whoa. How far is it?

260
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,671
Not far. Just to the shadows.

261
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:04,742
But don't worry,
everyone's been there.

262
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,241
We've never been
that far before.

263
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:08,277
- What if we get lost?
- Relax, Nala.

264
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:11,905
I patrolled the entire kingdom
this morning with my dad.

265
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:13,517
There's nothing to worry about.

266
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:15,586
Well, there is one thing.

267
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:19,181
We have an imminent threat.
Something is approaching.

268
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:21,292
Oh. Wait. Scratch that.
That's my own shadow.

270
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,123
Trust me, I got this.

271
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:26,628
Follow me to freedom.

273
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:33,299
to see the future king
with his future queen.

274
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:35,201
I could just molt.

275
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:37,001
What do you mean,
"future queen"?

276
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,009
Well, one day the two of you
will be betrothed.

277

00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:46,443

280
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:48,883

One day you will be married.

281

We are never
getting married, Zazu.

291
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:08,564
With an attitude like that.

292
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:10,972

a pretty pathetic king.

tell me where to go.

294

What to do...
and even who to marry.

295
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:17,979
There will never be a king
like me.

296

your destiny.

297

00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:49,359
It gets bigger.

716
00:52:49,533 --> 00:52:51,364
Can we keep him?
Can we please keep him?

717
00:52:51,535 --> 00:52:53,435
Oh, oh, okay. I promise
I'll walk him every day!

718
00:52:53,604 --> 00:52:55,015
If he makes a little mess,
I'll clean it up.

719
00:52:55,039 --> 00:52:56,131
You'll be his little mess!

720
00:52:56,306 --> 00:52:58,466
He's gonna eat you and then
use my body as a toothpick!

721
00:52:58,509 --> 00:53:00,477
But one day,
when he's big and strong,

722
00:53:00,544 --> 00:53:01,806
he'll be on our side!

723
00:53:01,979 --> 00:53:04,311
I've got it.
What if he's on our side?

724
00:53:04,481 --> 00:53:05,675
Hear me out!

725
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:09,842
Having a ferocious lion around
might not be such a bad idea!

726
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,317
Well then, can we keep him?

727
00:53:11,488 --> 00:53:12,728
Yes, of course we can keep him!

728
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:15,450
My God, who is the brains
of this operation?

729
00:53:15,626 --> 00:53:17,389

We're gonna name him Fred!

Hordes of them. Flocks.

I'm Pumbaa.

- This is Timon.
- Did I mention

737
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:30,969
that we saved your life?

738
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:33,176
It doesn't matter.

739
00:53:34,978 --> 00:53:37,208
Whoa. How bleak is that?

00:53:40,751 --> 00:53:42,184
Now his problems
are my problems?

00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:44,432
But we can help him. We're
in a position to help him.

744

(GROANS) So, how are you,
in as few words as possible?

745
00:53:48,992 --> 00:53:50,892
I did something terrible.

746
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:52,892
I don't wanna talk about it.

747
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:55,691
Look, kid,
we've all made mistakes.

748
00:53:55,766 --> 00:53:58,496
Uh, there must be something
we can do, right?

749
00:53:58,669 --> 00:54:00,660
Not unless you can change
the past.

750
00:54:00,838 --> 00:54:02,215
Well, you know,
that's a lot to ask...

751
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,349
That's pretty hard.
That's a biggie.

752
00:54:03,373 --> 00:54:04,417
TIMON: If I'm being honest.

753
00:54:04,441 --> 00:54:06,152
I mean, change the past?
It already happened.

754
00:54:06,176 --> 00:54:07,837
Yeah, so you can't change that.

755
00:54:08,011 --> 00:54:09,291
But you know
what you can change?

756
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:12,339
The future.
That's our specialty.

Kind of ourthing.

00:54:14,017 --> 00:54:16,417
How can you change something
that hasn't happened?

759
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:18,680
Well, to change the future,

760
00:54:18,756 --> 00:54:20,223
you got to put your past
behind you.

761
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:21,390
Way behind.

762
00:54:21,458 --> 00:54:23,756
Look, kid, bad things happen

763
00:54:23,861 --> 00:54:26,022
and you can't do anything
about it, right?

764
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:27,096
Right.

765
00:54:27,231 --> 00:54:29,791
Wrong! When the world
turns its back on you...

766
00:54:29,967 --> 00:54:31,764
you turn your back on the world!

767
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:34,132
And only embrace what's next!

768
00:54:34,304 --> 00:54:36,204
And turn the "what"
into "so what?"

769
00:54:36,373 --> 00:54:38,466
Well, that's not
what I was taught.

770
00:54:38,642 --> 00:54:40,542
Well, then maybe
you need a new lesson.

I can't go back. Ever.

1218
01:22:11,527 --> 01:22:12,721
Why?

1219
01:22:12,895 --> 01:22:14,624
Because of what happened
at the gorge?

1220

1221
01:22:16,098 --> 01:22:17,292
You wouldn't understand!

1222
01:22:17,466 --> 01:22:18,899
None of It matters. Okay?

01:22:21,737 --> 01:22:23,466
It's something
I learned out here, okay?

1226
01:22:23,639 --> 01:22:25,266
You see,
sometimes bad things happen,

1227
01:22:25,374 --> 01:22:26,966
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

1228
01:22:27,142 --> 01:22:28,609
So, why worry?

1229
01:22:28,877 --> 01:22:30,742
Why worry?

1230
01:22:30,913 --> 01:22:32,778

It will take some time,

1587

we will build our army.

KAMARI: "Friends", huh?

1589
01:44:02,436 --> 01:44:06,099
I thought you said we were
"revolting scavengers"?

1590
01:44:06,273 --> 01:44:09,208
Yeah.
That you wanted to kill us?

1591
01:44:09,376 --> 01:44:10,376
No.

1592
01:44:10,511 --> 01:44:11,671
No, let me explain.

1593
01:44:12,346 --> 01:44:14,712
I was trying to fool him.

1594
01:44:14,882 --> 01:44:16,349
We will rule together!

1595
01:44:17,585 --> 01:44:20,679
There's only one true thing
you ever said, Scar.

1596
01:44:22,957 --> 01:44:27,092
"A hyena's belly...

On the path unwinding.

In the circle.

1612

MAN: (SINGING) It's never
too late to turn things around.

1616

Recover, unravel the path
to confound.

1617
01:48:33,841 --> 01:48:37,538
The doubters and losers
that line up despair.

Who tell you it's over,
you're goin' nowhere.

It's never too late, I hope
It's never too late.

It's never too late
to get back on track.

1621
01:48:53,160 --> 01:48:56,960
To get at least some,
if not all of it back

1622
01:48:57,031 --> 01:49:00,728
I thought I was happy,
and sometimes I was.

1623
01:49:00,834 --> 01:49:04,326
But sadness is just
as important because.

1624
01:49:04,405 --> 01:49:07,636
Got to carry the weight and hope.

1625

But time is now, my friend

1632
01:49:24,158 --> 01:49:27,753
I'm a long way from the start
But further from the end.

Oh, no, It's never too late.

to get up off the ground.

Don't have to be noticed,
don't have to be crowned

I did what I've done,
and I don't try to hide

I've lost many things,
but never my pride.

It's never too late, I know
It's never too late.

Never too late.

1649

I'm sleepin' tonight.

1650
01:50:37,598 --> 01:50:41,466
A day doin' nothin'
is doin' it right.

1651

No hurry, no hurry,
it takes as long as it takes.

1652
01:50:45,405 --> 01:50:46,929
You might as well sleep

1653
01:50:47,007 --> 01:50:48,941
for all the difference it makes

1654
01:50:49,009 --> 01:50:52,775
I didn't find love
or peace on the breaks.

1655

These aren't excuses,
but a string of mistakes
