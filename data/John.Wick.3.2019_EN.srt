1
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,743
John Wick, Excommunicado.

2
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,576
In effect, 6:00 p.m.,
Eastern Standard Time.

3
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,844
I do hope that Mr. Wick
finds his way to safety.

4
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:04,799
He knew the rules, he broke them.

5
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:07,135
He killed a man
on company grounds, Charon.

6
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:09,512
Do you expect him to make it out?

7
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,347
Fourteen-million-dollar bounty
on his head.

8
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:14,354
Every interested party in this city
wants a piece of it.

9
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,278
I'd say the odds are about even.

10
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,276
You think the hospital's there to
help, man?

11
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,292
No way!

12
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:42,424
They'll kill you
just as soon as they'll make you better.

13
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:46,224
But I know better, man.
I know better. I know what I'm...

14
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,851
Tick tock, Mr. Wick. Tick tock.

15
00:03:57,529 --> 00:04:02,775
Tick tock. Tick tock. Tick...

16
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,985
No time to dilly-dally, Mr. Wick!

17
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,592
The New York Public Library.

18
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:22,678
You got it.

19
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:43,491
Change of plan.

20
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:47,656
To the Continental.

21
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,704
Can you see that he's received
by the concierge?

22
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,036
Yes, sir, Mr. Wick.

23
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:57,920
Good dog. Good dog.

24
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:12,223
John Wick, Excommunicado.
In effect, 20 minutes.

25
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,083
Can I help you?

26
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:37,331
<i>Russian Folktale</i>. Alexander Afanasyev.

27
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,292
1864.

28
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:52,850
- Level two.
- Thank you.

29
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,567
"Consider your origins.

30
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,903
You were not made to live as brutes,
but to follow virtue and knowledge."

31
00:06:58,835 --> 00:06:59,835
Dante.

32
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,542
Looking a little run down there, John.

33
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,799
Ernest. I still have time.

34
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:10,720
It's almost up.
Who's gonna know the difference?

35
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,263
You sure this is what you wanna do?

36
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,091
Fourteen million. It's a lot of money.

37
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,225
Not if you can't spend it.

38
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,706
Shh.

39
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:54,172
Oh, shit.

40
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,856
Push it back.

41
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:07,204
John Wick, Excommunicado.
In effect, 10 minutes.

42
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,967
Let it be known the Bowery
will honor the Excommunicado.

43
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:25,438
No help, no services of any kind.

44
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:39,994
Doc! Doc, it's Wick!

45
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,790
Mr. Wick.

46
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:45,332
No, no. You shouldn't be here.
Hour's almost up.

47
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,080
I know, Doc, please. There's still time.

48
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,581
No. I can't.

49
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,037
I still have five minutes.

50
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:52,794
Please.

51
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:00,766
Come on. Come on.

52
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:08,643
All right, sit there.

53
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:15,835
All right, let me see.
Let me see.

54
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,449
Uh-huh.

55
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,651
Puncture wound.

56
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:24,447
Ah, went deep. Nicked the artery.

57
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,292
Here you go.

58
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:30,379
All right.

59
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:38,136
John Wick, Excommunicado.
In effect, one minute.

60
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,317
- Doc?
- Hmm?

61
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,323
Doc?

62
00:10:58,408 --> 00:10:59,899
Yeah. We're halfway there.

63
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,282
- Five seconds.
- Yeah.

64
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,864
John Wick, Excommunicado.

65
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:10,998
In effect in five, four...

66
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,996
Three, two...

67
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,876
One.

68
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:26,638
Sorry, Mr. Wick.

69
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:28,723
I know. Rules.

70
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,475
Ah, rules.

71
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,562
John Wick, 14 million.

72
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,739
Open contract is now in effect.

73
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,238
All services are suspended.

74
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:15,858
And away we go.

75
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:44,837
Top shelf. On the right.
Yeah. Take four.

76
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,844
It will give you energy.
Help with the pain.

77
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,105
Mr. Wick?

78
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,113
They'll never believe
I stopped on the hour.

79
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,697
But you did.

80
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:05,784
They'll know.

81
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:07,655
Know what?

82
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,361
I told you where the medicine was.

83
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:27,592
Where?

84
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:30,516
Here. Just below my floating rib.
Be sure not to hit my...

85
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,137
Oh, wait!

86
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,389
One may not be enough.

87
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,444
Yeah. All right.

88
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:45,989
Be sure not to graze my...

89
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:48,651
Oh!

90
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:56,951
Good luck, Mr. Wick.

91
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:01,330
Thanks, Doc.

92
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:44,338
John Wick. Open contract.
Increase, 15 million.

93
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,133
Where are you going, Jonathan?

94
00:23:58,562 --> 00:23:59,928
We are closed.

95
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:58,345
Jardani.

96
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:01,599
Why have you come home?

97
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:09,016
You present this to me like an answer.

98
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,605
I still have my ticket.

99
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:16,406
After all the chaos you've caused
for the last few weeks,

100
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:18,529
you think your ticket is valid?

101
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:22,908
You forget that the Ruska Roma
is bound by the High Table,

102
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:25,285
and the High Table stands above all?

103
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:28,410
They could kill me
just for talking to you.

104
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:34,796
You honor me
by bringing death to my front door.

105
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:41,094
Oh, Jardani, what has become of you?

106
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:01,150
You are bound...

107
00:27:01,245 --> 00:27:03,362
and I am owed.

108
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:09,538
Rooney, enough!

109
00:27:41,535 --> 00:27:44,198
"You are owed."
You are owed nothing, Jardani.

110
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:48,407
You know, when my pupils first come here,
they wish for one thing.

111
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,911
A life free of suffering.

112
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:53,624
I try to dissuade them
from these childish notions,

113
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:55,751
but as you know,

114
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:57,666
art is pain.

115
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:02,879
Life is suffering.

116
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:10,394
Somehow, you managed to get out.

117
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:14,016
But here you are, back where you began.

118
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,646
All of this, for what?

119
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:57,142
Pirouette.

120
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:59,273
Pirouette, pirouette.

121
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:03,568
Sit.

122
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:22,084
Even if I wanted to,
I can't help you, Jardani.

123
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:25,344
The High Table wants your life.

124
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:27,839
How can you fight the wind?

125
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:32,390
How can you smash the mountains?
How can you bury the ocean?

126
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:35,847
How can you escape from the light?

127
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:40,481
Of course, you can go to the dark.
But they're in the dark, too.

128
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:48,156
So tell me, Jardani,
what do you really want?

129
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:51,914
Passage.

130
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:54,874
Where did you want to go?

131
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:57,998
Casablanca.

132
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:03,466
The path to paradise begins in hell.

133
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,006
So be it.

134
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:13,976
You hand me your ticket, I will tear it.

135
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:17,639
If that's what you really desire.

136
00:30:57,022 --> 00:31:00,481
With this, Jardani, your ticket is torn.

137
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,280
You can never come home again.

138
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:15,830
Take him to the lifeboat.

139
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:18,832
<i>Do svidanya.</i>

140
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:23,458
<i>Do svidanya.</i>

141
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:57,622
Welcome to the Continental.
How may I help you?

142
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:20,603
Sir. There is an Adjudicator
here to see you.

143
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:23,396
Very well, sir.

144
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,648
The manager is in the lounge.

145
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:36,490
I presume
you're here to discuss John Wick.

146
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:39,747
If that's so, we can make this short.

147
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:43,535
I told him to walk away,
he declined to do so.

148
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:44,994
And that's the all of it.

149
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:47,379
Mr. Wick broke the rules.

150
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:48,582
Oh, yes.

151
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,759
And I haven't got the slightest idea
where he is...

152
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:54,921
You're mistaken.
I'm not here for Mr. Wick.

153
00:32:55,015 --> 00:32:57,382
I'm here because
Mr. Wick broke the rules in this hotel.

154
00:32:57,476 --> 00:32:58,808
- Hmm.
- The blood was spilt

155
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:01,136
on the grounds of the Continental,
was it not?

156
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,345
Oh, yes.

157
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:06,604
As a matter of fact, the body gets colder
within these very walls.

158
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:08,518
I'd like to see it.

159
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:38,798
Santino D'Antonio.

160
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:41,843
A newly instated member of the High Table,

161
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:45,851
slain by Mr. Wick while
seeking sanctuary in the Continental.

162
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:52,736
With a.45 ACP, it appears.

163
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:56,820
I had no control over Mr. Wick's actions.

164
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:59,448
And yet, he lives
because you deemed it so, yes?

165
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:01,700
Yes.

166
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,782
You have known Mr. Wick
for a great many years.

167
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,912
It might even be fair
to call you friends, yes?

168
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,503
Instead of stopping him,
instead of killing him,

169
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:11,421
you stood by and let him walk away

170
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:13,966
after he shot Santino D'Antonio
in front of you.

171
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,009
I made him Excommunicado.

172
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:18,930
But not before
you gave him an hour to escape.

173
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:20,551
He broke the rules in my hotel.

174
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:24,636
This is exactly the problem: your hotel.
Where is your fealty?

175
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:27,806
I've been of service for over 40 years.

176
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:31,643
Under the Table. Serving the Table.
Everything is under the Table.

177
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,774
I understand that you have your loyalties,
but this cannot be overlooked.

178
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:38,107
Let me be clear. I am here to adjudge you.

179
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:40,534
You have one week
to get your affairs in order.

180
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:42,952
Excuse me?

181
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:45,782
At such time,
your successor will be named.

182
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:49,126
There are rules,

183
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,932
they are the only things
that separate us...

184
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:52,087
From the animals.

185
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:54,631
Yes. You have seven days.

186
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:02,007
In the meantime, if you need
any assistance with your transition,

187
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,137
you may look for me in room 217.

188
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,854
Enjoy your stay at the Continental.

189
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,951
There's an Adjudicator here to see you.

190
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:40,386
Welcome to my mission control.

191
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:44,306
Brain stem of my operation.
The information super flyway.

192
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:46,475
From whence I control
the word on the street,

193
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:47,722
the way of the world.

194
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,478
With pigeons.

195
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:53,103
Yes. You see rats with wings,
but I see the Internet.

196
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:58,062
No IP addresses. No digital footprint.

197
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:02,196
Can't track it, can't hack it,
can't trace it.

198
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:03,992
Can you get disease from it?

199
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,862
Well, I wouldn't recommend
that you eat one.

200
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:09,623
What the hell do you want?

201
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,577
I wanted to see where it didn't happen.

202
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:14,333
Where what didn't happen?

203
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,084
Where you didn't kill John Wick.

204
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:18,624
I've always been under the impression

205
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:21,426
that contracts
and executing them was optional.

206
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:23,300
I have no problem with John Wick.

207
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:33,264
And yet, you gave John
a seven-round Kimber 1911,

208
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:36,647
knowing that he intended to use it
to stand against the Table. Yes?

209
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:43,733
This Kimber 1911, to be exact.

210
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:55,245
You gave John Wick seven bullets,
the High Table is giving you seven days.

211
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:58,168
Seven days for what, exactly?

212
00:36:58,258 --> 00:37:01,501
To settle your affairs
and find a new home for your birds.

213
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:04,420
In seven days, you abdicate your throne.

214
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:18,229
Oh, my dear.

215
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:20,982
Tell me, do you know
what the Bowery is, Adjudicator?

216
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,904
Do you know what happens
when I wave my hand?

217
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:26,947
No, there will be no replacement for me
on the throne.

218
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:29,494
Because I am the throne, baby.

219
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:31,447
I am the Bowery!

220
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:36,790
I am all that you deign not to look at
when you walk down the street at night.

221
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,499
The Bowery is mine. Mine alone.

222
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,221
Do not make the mistake of thinking
you exist outside the rules, no men do.

223
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:48,589
You have seven days.

224
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:29,986
Enough!

225
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,498
I'm afraid our friend here is off limits.

226
00:39:38,585 --> 00:39:41,043
But he's Excommunicado.

227
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:44,171
It seems the manager
has granted him amnesty.

228
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,669
Mr. Jonathan,
would you be so kind as to come with me?

229
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:12,407
Welcome to Casablanca, Mr. Wick.

230
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:14,527
Thanks.

231
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:22,501
Mr. Jonathan, it has been a long time

232
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:25,079
since our fine city
has been graced with your presence.

233
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:26,922
I need to talk to...

234
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:28,965
Yes, Ms. Al-Azwar, she's expecting you.

235
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:39,969
My, my,
welcome to the Moroccan Continental.

236
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:41,804
I hope you'll find it to your taste.

237
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:44,936
Right this way.

238
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:47,439
Ms. Al-Azwar, she waits for no man.

239
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:56,490
Best of luck, Mr. Jonathan. Best of luck.

240
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:33,438
You a dog person, John?

241
00:41:33,533 --> 00:41:35,320
Sofia?

242
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:44,499
Sofia, you can't kill
the bearer of your marker.

243
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:47,828
I didn't kill you. I just shot you.

244
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:50,334
Nice suit.

245
00:41:53,136 --> 00:41:54,718
Good to see you, too.

246
00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:56,966
I should shoot you in the head right now.

247
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:58,137
I know.

248
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:05,387
Don't you do it.

249
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:08,849
You're Excommunicado, John.

250
00:42:09,736 --> 00:42:14,197
And that marker doesn't mean shit.

251
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:21,324
This is your blood.

252
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,701
Your bond.

253
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:29,253
When you needed help, I was there.

254
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,221
Sit.

255
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:44,183
I was talking to you, John.

256
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:52,526
You do realize
that I'm management now, right?

257
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:55,900
I'm not service anymore, John.

258
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:58,949
So I don't go around
shooting people in the head.

259
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:03,989
I'm not asking you to kill anyone.
I just need you to get me to him.

260
00:43:04,624 --> 00:43:07,162
- To who?
- Your old boss.

261
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:10,585
You want to kill Berrada.

262
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:12,708
I'm not gonna kill him.
I just need to talk.

263
00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:15,291
What could he possibly give to you?

264
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:19,261
Guidance.

265
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:24,138
Look, I made a deal
when I agreed to run this hotel.

266
00:43:24,227 --> 00:43:27,686
And that deal said that I had to follow
the rules of the Table.

267
00:43:28,523 --> 00:43:31,607
If you're not gonna kill him,
he is gonna kill you,

268
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:34,560
and then probably me, too,
for walking you up in there.

269
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:39,106
If I make one mistake, one enemy...

270
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:44,070
maybe somebody goes
looking for my daughter.

271
00:43:45,498 --> 00:43:48,332
And I know what you did, John,
to get her out.

272
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:53,829
But that's not a chance I can take. Sorry.

273
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:58,175
Do you wanna know where she is?

274
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:01,841
No. I don't ever wanna know.

275
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:05,307
Because I don't trust
that I won't go find her.

276
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:09,265
A part of me longs for her.

277
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:14,691
And I have to kill that part
of myself every day,

278
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:16,393
just to keep her safe.

279
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:25,949
Because sometimes,
you have to kill what you love.

280
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:29,452
That's why I gave you that marker
in the first place.

281
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:33,331
That's why I'm sitting here right now
and that's why I'm fucked!

282
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:40,171
Consequences.

283
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:41,261
Yeah.

284
00:44:43,181 --> 00:44:45,047
Consequences.

285
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:49,184
I'm just asking you to try.

286
00:44:50,313 --> 00:44:53,602
Either way, you and me, we'll be even.

287
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:06,113
No.

288
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:13,034
After this, we are less than even.

289
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:19,164
We leave in 10 minutes.

290
00:46:15,982 --> 00:46:17,268
How can I help you?

291
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:31,991
I wasn't expecting the High Table so soon.

292
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:35,915
There is a task.

293
00:46:36,669 --> 00:46:39,878
It involves someone who broke the rules
and stood against the Table.

294
00:46:41,841 --> 00:46:43,082
John Wick, you mean.

295
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:45,633
My students have not been idle.

296
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:48,424
John Wick and all who've helped him.

297
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:51,427
You've heard the stories
about him, of course.

298
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:54,100
Killed scores of men
this past week alone because of...

299
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:56,553
A dog, a car.

300
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:58,806
I'm familiar.

301
00:47:02,111 --> 00:47:03,147
And I'm interested.

302
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:06,153
Very.

303
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:15,663
Blowfish. Very fatal.

304
00:47:20,588 --> 00:47:21,749
No soy.

305
00:47:30,473 --> 00:47:33,887
I have served, I will be of service.

306
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:16,655
Stop!

307
00:49:23,419 --> 00:49:24,419
Out!

308
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:34,094
The High Table and the Ruska Roma
have an understanding.

309
00:49:34,597 --> 00:49:37,590
Yes, and you helped John Wick.

310
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:38,764
He had a ticket.

311
00:49:38,851 --> 00:49:41,093
But a ticket does not stand
above the Table.

312
00:49:41,187 --> 00:49:44,021
Your penance will be paid in blood.

313
00:49:45,191 --> 00:49:46,191
Now...

314
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:53,063
hold out your helping hands
and pledge your fealty.

315
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:06,619
I have served, I will be of service.

316
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:31,480
We're not going in like the old days.

317
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:34,021
It's just a conversation.

318
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:38,901
Nothing's ever
just a conversation with you, John.

319
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:44,082
Let's go.

320
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,726
Sofia.

321
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:12,268
Always so nice to see you.

322
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:16,692
And the dogs, of course, how marvelous.
May I pet one?

323
00:51:17,575 --> 00:51:19,988
Certainly.

324
00:51:22,997 --> 00:51:24,613
Fantastic.

325
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:26,831
Jonathan Wick.

326
00:51:28,252 --> 00:51:31,370
I had heard
you had made your way to our shores.

327
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:38,258
Come along now.

328
00:51:38,846 --> 00:51:40,712
I am certain we have much to discuss.

329
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:49,934
I must admit, I am curious.
What brings you to my domain?

330
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:54,059
Tell me, do you come here to kill me?

331
00:51:56,989 --> 00:51:57,989
No.

332
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:11,501
Mr. Wick, do you know
where the word "assassin" comes from?

333
00:52:13,339 --> 00:52:16,377
People argue. "Assassin."

334
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:21,469
<i>Hashasheen,</i> followers of Hassan-i...

335
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:25,681
Eaters of hashish.

336
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:28,635
No, thank you.

337
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:33,648
But others contend
it comes from <i>asasiyyun.</i>

338
00:52:33,734 --> 00:52:37,899
Meaning, "men who are faithful
and who abide by their beliefs."

339
00:52:39,782 --> 00:52:41,023
You see that coin?

340
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:45,110
The first coin ever minted
in this facility.

341
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:48,909
Next to it, the first marker.

342
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:51,325
Not easy to track down, believe me.

343
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:55,962
Now, this coin, of course,
it does not represent monetary value.

344
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:59,712
It represents
the commerce of relationships,

345
00:52:59,802 --> 00:53:03,216
a social contract
in which you agree to partake.

346
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:05,550
Order and rules.

347
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:11,603
You have broken the rules.
The High Table has marked you for death.

348
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:14,104
Why would I allow you to leave here alive,

349
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:17,980
when your life has been,
by your own actions, forfeit?

350
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:24,987
I seek to make amends.

351
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:27,777
To pay for what I've done.

352
00:53:28,414 --> 00:53:31,907
I seek a meeting
with the one who sits above the Table.

353
00:53:36,547 --> 00:53:40,336
This dog, I do so love it. Hmm.

354
00:53:40,426 --> 00:53:43,169
Tell me, does it shed a great deal?

355
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:47,381
Occasionally.

356
00:53:48,267 --> 00:53:50,600
When I leave,
you can tell the Elder I'm coming,

357
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,560
and if he wants me dead...

358
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:56,014
Then he will see to it
that your bones bleach under the sun.

359
00:53:57,443 --> 00:53:58,479
I see.

360
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:01,277
And I would have provided him
with a choice.

361
00:54:08,871 --> 00:54:10,578
I am sorry, Mr. Wick.

362
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:13,831
I cannot tell you where to find the Elder.

363
00:54:16,879 --> 00:54:18,245
You fail to understand.

364
00:54:18,714 --> 00:54:22,583
The Elder is not a man you find.
He can only choose to find you.

365
00:54:23,177 --> 00:54:24,634
You wish to speak with him?

366
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:27,678
Go to the edge of the desert, look up.

367
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:30,093
Canis Minor,

368
00:54:30,184 --> 00:54:33,222
the dog that followed Orion
through the sky.

369
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:37,806
You follow the brightest star,
walk until you are almost dead,

370
00:54:38,317 --> 00:54:40,309
then, keep walking.

371
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:43,982
When you are on your last breath,
he will find you...

372
00:54:45,741 --> 00:54:47,152
or he will not.

373
00:54:48,911 --> 00:54:50,322
I am grateful.

374
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:54,330
Thank you, sir.

375
00:54:57,044 --> 00:54:59,036
Perhaps you were not listening before.

376
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:04,840
The social contract.

377
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:08,169
The commerce of relationships.

378
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:12,553
You have received a great gift.
I have hosted your friend.

379
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:16,011
What do you offer in return?

380
00:55:20,192 --> 00:55:23,026
So soft and yet so fierce.

381
00:55:23,821 --> 00:55:25,733
I love it, this dog.

382
00:55:27,366 --> 00:55:28,698
I will keep it.

383
00:55:28,784 --> 00:55:29,945
Excuse me?

384
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:34,245
This will be my gift.
This will be how you show me your fealty.

385
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:35,538
No.

386
00:55:35,916 --> 00:55:37,782
Surely it's the least you can do.

387
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:39,833
No, you cannot keep my dog.

388
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:42,046
Very well.

389
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:44,715
Very well.

390
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:48,755
Then I will kill it.

391
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:58,053
I'm sorry, Sofia.
This was for you to learn.

392
00:56:06,738 --> 00:56:07,738
Don't.

393
00:56:49,573 --> 00:56:51,565
Sofia, don't.

394
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:58,199
He shot my dog.

395
00:56:59,917 --> 00:57:01,203
I get it.

396
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:05,586
We gotta go. Now.

397
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:42,565
Here you go.

398
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:49,402
You're gonna die, John.

399
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:52,360
Whether out here in this desert,

400
01:03:53,455 --> 01:03:55,412
or somewhere else down the road.

401
01:03:57,667 --> 01:03:59,078
But you are gonna die.

402
01:04:14,809 --> 01:04:16,345
Consequences.

403
01:04:20,482 --> 01:04:21,814
Consequences.

404
01:04:48,676 --> 01:04:49,792
Better get going.

405
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:00,890
Sofia.

406
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:43,432
Okay.

407
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:50,476
You made your point.

408
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:54,150
You have earned my fealty.

409
01:07:55,405 --> 01:07:58,364
Matter of fact,
I'm gonna shove so much fealty up your ass

410
01:07:58,449 --> 01:08:00,156
it's gonna come
spilling out of your mouth.

411
01:08:00,243 --> 01:08:02,075
You had your chance.

412
01:08:02,579 --> 01:08:04,571
Well, since you see it that way,

413
01:08:05,498 --> 01:08:07,706
I guess it's time I told you

414
01:08:07,792 --> 01:08:11,581
to climb down off your High Table
and go fuck yourself.

415
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:13,082
Duly noted.

416
01:08:13,715 --> 01:08:19,177
You gave John Wick seven bullets,
your penance will be paid with seven cuts.

417
01:08:19,262 --> 01:08:21,845
Well, sometimes you gotta
cut a motherfucker.

418
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:27,218
Avert your eyes, my sweet.

419
01:08:28,896 --> 01:08:31,764
The king is dead.

420
01:08:36,863 --> 01:08:38,604
Long live the king.

421
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:33,621
Drink.

422
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:37,253
Don't worry, your weapon is still there.

423
01:09:38,508 --> 01:09:39,508
Please drink.

424
01:09:49,894 --> 01:09:53,228
My son, how have you come to be so lost?

425
01:09:54,107 --> 01:09:55,314
Not lost.

426
01:09:56,526 --> 01:09:58,062
Looking for you.

427
01:09:58,152 --> 01:09:59,939
You think
I speak of your location?

428
01:10:02,156 --> 01:10:05,991
Never seen a man fight so hard
to end up back where he started.

429
01:10:13,918 --> 01:10:15,534
So tell me, Jonathan.

430
01:10:16,129 --> 01:10:17,245
Why do you wish to live?

431
01:10:18,589 --> 01:10:21,502
My wife, Helen.

432
01:10:24,345 --> 01:10:25,461
To remember her.

433
01:10:27,306 --> 01:10:28,797
To remember us.

434
01:10:29,392 --> 01:10:31,975
So you seek to live
for the memory of love?

435
01:10:33,813 --> 01:10:35,896
At least a chance to earn it.

436
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:40,688
I can give you one last chance
to earn a life.

437
01:10:41,988 --> 01:10:43,945
However, it might not be
the life that you wish.

438
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:49,364
Complete a task for us,
and your Excommunicado will be reversed.

439
01:10:49,787 --> 01:10:51,323
The open contract closed.

440
01:10:51,998 --> 01:10:53,910
You would be permitted
to continue to live.

441
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,038
Not free under the Table, but bound to it.

442
01:10:57,128 --> 01:11:00,087
Doing what you do best
for the rest of your days.

443
01:11:04,594 --> 01:11:06,051
The choice is yours.

444
01:11:08,222 --> 01:11:09,508
Die here and now

445
01:11:10,475 --> 01:11:12,888
or continue to live
and remember through death.

446
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:32,910
What must be done?

447
01:11:32,997 --> 01:11:35,284
The cost of your life
will be the death of others.

448
01:11:36,083 --> 01:11:38,541
The first of which will be
the man they call Winston.

449
01:11:39,754 --> 01:11:40,915
What?

450
01:11:41,005 --> 01:11:42,712
He has forgotten his fealty.

451
01:11:43,674 --> 01:11:47,293
Neither the open contract
nor the Excommunicado will be lifted

452
01:11:47,386 --> 01:11:48,752
until you complete your task.

453
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:53,056
So if you wish to live,
and if you wish to remember,

454
01:11:54,393 --> 01:11:56,305
this is the choice you must make.

455
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:14,570
I will serve.

456
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:19,328
I will be of service.

457
01:12:20,294 --> 01:12:21,660
Very well, my son.

458
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:26,582
Cast aside your weakness
and reaffirm your fealty to the Table.

459
01:12:33,391 --> 01:12:34,598
Mr. John Wick.

460
01:13:22,607 --> 01:13:23,848
Thank you.

461
01:13:25,443 --> 01:13:28,652
I accept this offering and your fealty.

462
01:13:46,464 --> 01:13:48,376
I wish you good luck on your path.

463
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:52,008
Zahir will help you prepare
for your departure.

464
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:54,930
And, Mr. Wick...

465
01:14:34,762 --> 01:14:38,005
<i>JFK Express now arriving on platform nine.</i>

466
01:14:38,099 --> 01:14:40,887
<i>JFK Express now arriving on platform nine.</i>

467
01:16:03,601 --> 01:16:05,342
Stick together, kids.

468
01:16:05,436 --> 01:16:09,305
Make sure you're holding the hand
of the person in front and behind you.

469
01:16:12,151 --> 01:16:15,394
You see?
That's why you're special, John Wick.

470
01:16:18,741 --> 01:16:20,448
I wouldn't have stopped.

471
01:16:21,952 --> 01:16:23,534
It's good to have you back.

472
01:16:30,461 --> 01:16:31,622
How was your trip?

473
01:16:34,924 --> 01:16:36,460
Going to the Continental?

474
01:16:43,057 --> 01:16:44,057
He with you?

475
01:16:44,767 --> 01:16:47,054
He was.

476
01:16:57,363 --> 01:16:58,774
Nice trick.

477
01:20:06,510 --> 01:20:09,344
Sir! Put your weapon down.

478
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:12,255
He's Excommunicado.

479
01:20:13,434 --> 01:20:19,431
Unless you wish to become the same,
I suggest you lower your gun.

480
01:20:25,988 --> 01:20:28,071
I'd like to see the manager.

481
01:20:30,617 --> 01:20:31,617
Of course.

482
01:20:32,745 --> 01:20:35,032
If you would be so kind as to follow me.

483
01:20:48,427 --> 01:20:51,886
Please take a seat.
I will let him know you have arrived.

484
01:21:27,049 --> 01:21:28,540
I gotta tell you,

485
01:21:28,634 --> 01:21:31,752
I've been looking forward
to meeting you for a long time.

486
01:21:31,845 --> 01:21:35,213
I'm a huge fan, John Wick.

487
01:21:35,641 --> 01:21:39,055
And so far, you haven't disappointed.

488
01:21:43,732 --> 01:21:47,066
Is that the dog? He likes you.

489
01:21:48,112 --> 01:21:51,981
Me? I'm more of a cat person myself.

490
01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:53,950
Hey, dog.

491
01:21:57,579 --> 01:22:01,619
We're the same, you know.
Both given the same gift.

492
01:22:02,042 --> 01:22:03,158
We're not the same.

493
01:22:04,002 --> 01:22:05,288
Yes, we are.

494
01:22:06,213 --> 01:22:07,294
No, we're not.

495
01:22:09,007 --> 01:22:13,047
The manager is ready for you now.
In the administrative lounge, sir.

496
01:22:27,734 --> 01:22:29,191
Mr. Wick.

497
01:22:31,405 --> 01:22:32,405
Sit.

498
01:22:33,824 --> 01:22:35,156
Stay.

499
01:22:36,577 --> 01:22:37,658
Good dog.

500
01:23:33,926 --> 01:23:36,088
Tread carefully, Jonathan.

501
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:48,179
We only use this room
on special occasions.

502
01:23:48,273 --> 01:23:52,267
When you simply have to see
what your opponent is holding

503
01:23:52,361 --> 01:23:53,727
under the table.

504
01:23:55,864 --> 01:23:57,901
How was your journey here? Eventful?

505
01:23:59,159 --> 01:24:00,275
Yeah.

506
01:24:00,369 --> 01:24:01,369
Well, of course.

507
01:24:02,663 --> 01:24:06,782
They sent men to kill you,
and now you to kill me.

508
01:24:08,168 --> 01:24:09,784
Isn't that why you're here?

509
01:24:10,170 --> 01:24:14,540
I have served, I will be of service.

510
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:18,046
But you're having doubts.

511
01:24:19,888 --> 01:24:22,551
Just don't make the mistake of pretending
this is personal.

512
01:24:23,517 --> 01:24:25,429
If you feel you must...

513
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:30,146
put a bullet through my heart.

514
01:24:36,947 --> 01:24:39,280
The High Table has asked me to step down.

515
01:24:39,741 --> 01:24:40,777
The hour?

516
01:24:41,577 --> 01:24:42,818
The hour.

517
01:24:42,911 --> 01:24:45,153
You should have killed me
in the Continental.

518
01:24:46,331 --> 01:24:47,617
Maybe I should have.

519
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:50,912
Rules and consequences.

520
01:24:51,336 --> 01:24:52,827
Hmm.

521
01:24:52,921 --> 01:24:56,380
It seems like everyone is suffering
from the consequences of their actions.

522
01:24:56,967 --> 01:24:58,754
And you're not stepping down?

523
01:25:01,179 --> 01:25:02,215
No.

524
01:25:03,557 --> 01:25:04,673
I don't think I am.

525
01:25:05,517 --> 01:25:06,974
So it's war?

526
01:25:07,561 --> 01:25:09,553
You're going to war with the High Table?

527
01:25:10,188 --> 01:25:11,188
Skirmish.

528
01:25:11,732 --> 01:25:13,189
Unless you decide to shoot me.

529
01:25:13,275 --> 01:25:16,643
But then, I'd rather die
at the hand of a friend

530
01:25:17,321 --> 01:25:18,562
than that of an enemy.

531
01:25:20,073 --> 01:25:22,656
No, I've made my choice.
It's up to you to make yours.

532
01:25:24,494 --> 01:25:25,780
What choice?

533
01:25:26,997 --> 01:25:29,410
You shoot me, you sell your soul.

534
01:25:29,499 --> 01:25:33,083
But I'll be alive. And I can remember her.

535
01:25:33,170 --> 01:25:36,504
Until you die as a servant
of the High Table.

536
01:25:36,590 --> 01:25:40,584
Now, you did the impossible,
you stopped, you got out.

537
01:25:41,219 --> 01:25:44,553
You only came back because
Helen was taken away from you.

538
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:48,350
The real question is,
who do you wish to die as?

539
01:25:49,227 --> 01:25:50,308
The Baba Yaga?

540
01:25:50,896 --> 01:25:52,888
The last thing many men ever see?

541
01:25:52,981 --> 01:25:57,476
Or as a man who loved
and was loved by his wife?

542
01:25:58,070 --> 01:26:00,562
Who do you wish to die as, Jonathan?

543
01:26:32,813 --> 01:26:37,433
Mr. Wick, it's a pleasure to meet you.
I am an Adjudicator.

544
01:26:39,027 --> 01:26:40,643
Have you decided to step down?

545
01:26:43,407 --> 01:26:44,648
I think not.

546
01:26:46,284 --> 01:26:49,243
And you? Will you be putting
a bullet in his head?

547
01:26:52,749 --> 01:26:55,537
No, I don't think I will.

548
01:27:03,635 --> 01:27:04,796
Very well.

549
01:27:13,228 --> 01:27:14,844
Administration.

550
01:27:14,938 --> 01:27:16,930
<i>I'd like to change a designation.</i>

551
01:27:17,774 --> 01:27:18,890
Verification?

552
01:27:18,984 --> 01:27:22,102
<i>Adjudication 1-0-1-1-9-7-9.</i>

553
01:27:22,195 --> 01:27:24,278
The Continental Hotel, New York.

554
01:27:24,364 --> 01:27:25,730
<i>New designation?</i>

555
01:27:26,283 --> 01:27:27,569
Deconsecrated.

556
01:27:30,412 --> 01:27:31,412
Processing.

557
01:27:33,999 --> 01:27:35,035
Administrator.

558
01:27:36,460 --> 01:27:40,044
File. The New York Continental Hotel.

559
01:27:51,224 --> 01:27:55,343
The New York Continental Hotel
has been deconsecrated. Goodbye.

560
01:28:02,944 --> 01:28:05,402
Gentlemen, this institution
is now deconsecrated.

561
01:28:05,489 --> 01:28:08,232
Business may now be conducted
on Continental grounds.

562
01:28:08,325 --> 01:28:12,535
Since you are refusing to step down
and you are refusing a direct order,

563
01:28:12,621 --> 01:28:14,453
your lives are now forfeit.

564
01:28:14,873 --> 01:28:17,081
High Table emissaries
will be joining you presently

565
01:28:17,167 --> 01:28:19,659
to see the removal
of your souls from the property.

566
01:28:21,171 --> 01:28:23,003
Good evening, gentlemen.

567
01:28:27,344 --> 01:28:30,462
This haven is safe no more.

568
01:28:33,225 --> 01:28:35,808
Are services still off limits to me?

569
01:28:36,728 --> 01:28:40,096
Under the circumstances, your privileges
are reinstated immediately.

570
01:28:40,190 --> 01:28:41,431
What do you need?

571
01:28:42,192 --> 01:28:45,230
Guns. Lots of guns.

572
01:29:03,630 --> 01:29:05,587
Let's make a withdrawal.

573
01:29:29,823 --> 01:29:33,692
Remember, sir,
these will be High Table forces.

574
01:29:33,785 --> 01:29:36,198
We may have to consider
our choices carefully.

575
01:29:36,872 --> 01:29:38,113
Why?

576
01:29:38,206 --> 01:29:39,822
Much has changed during your time away.

577
01:29:40,542 --> 01:29:41,908
Like what?

578
01:29:42,002 --> 01:29:44,665
Well, let us say
they have made armor improvements.

579
01:29:52,637 --> 01:29:56,472
May I suggest the 2011 Combat Master

580
01:29:56,558 --> 01:29:58,800
in combination with
the nine millimeter Major.

581
01:30:10,405 --> 01:30:12,146
<i>Attention, all guests.</i>

582
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:14,698
<i>The Continental Hotel
is closing for fumigation.</i>

583
01:30:15,660 --> 01:30:19,324
<i>We apologize for the inconvenience.
Please make your way to the nearest exit.</i>

584
01:30:24,252 --> 01:30:26,960
<i>Attention, all guests.
The Continental Hotel...</i>

585
01:30:27,047 --> 01:30:30,586
It seems circumstances
have changed in your favor.

586
01:30:30,675 --> 01:30:33,839
Your transaction may now be conducted
on Continental grounds.

587
01:30:39,684 --> 01:30:42,848
We'll be sending some of our finest
for additional support.

588
01:30:42,938 --> 01:30:45,851
Cool. Very cool.

589
01:30:50,820 --> 01:30:57,033
125 grain,
1,425 feet per second. Serious business.

590
01:31:00,747 --> 01:31:01,747
Thank you.

591
01:31:02,332 --> 01:31:03,994
Let us begin.

592
01:32:50,273 --> 01:32:53,107
Charon, would you help set
the mood for our new guests?

593
01:32:53,985 --> 01:32:55,192
Of course, sir.

594
01:33:17,050 --> 01:33:19,633
I know you'll do the Continental proud.

595
01:33:19,719 --> 01:33:21,255
I'll see you soon, sir.

596
01:33:24,390 --> 01:33:27,474
And you, Jonathan, do what you do best.

597
01:33:28,061 --> 01:33:29,061
What's that?

598
01:33:29,979 --> 01:33:31,186
Hunt.

599
01:37:04,902 --> 01:37:08,020
Winston! Winston!

600
01:37:12,493 --> 01:37:14,029
I need more firepower.

601
01:37:37,393 --> 01:37:38,929
Armor improvements.

602
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:42,354
Twelve-gauge steel slugs. Armor-piercing.

603
01:41:09,814 --> 01:41:11,726
Only by my sword, John.

604
01:41:24,328 --> 01:41:26,390
<i>I know you
believe you can keep this up.</i>

605
01:41:26,414 --> 01:41:27,621
<i>But I assure you...</i>

606
01:49:32,816 --> 01:49:35,479
John, you're incredible.

607
01:49:36,403 --> 01:49:41,239
Exhausted, outnumbered, obviously in pain,

608
01:49:42,576 --> 01:49:45,114
and you still beat all of my students.

609
01:49:45,454 --> 01:49:50,074
If I didn't have to kill you,
we'd be... pals.

610
01:49:51,085 --> 01:49:52,166
Let's do this.

611
01:50:20,114 --> 01:50:22,231
See? We're the same.

612
01:54:09,217 --> 01:54:11,209
I would like to suggest a parley.

613
01:54:11,970 --> 01:54:13,506
A parley would be good.

614
01:54:13,597 --> 01:54:14,597
<i>Very well.</i>

615
01:54:26,234 --> 01:54:27,770
Are we in play, sir?

616
01:54:29,446 --> 01:54:30,778
Oh, very much so.

617
01:54:50,300 --> 01:54:51,757
Hey, John.

618
01:54:54,221 --> 01:54:56,304
That was a pretty good fight, huh?

619
01:55:00,435 --> 01:55:01,435
Yeah.

620
01:55:31,258 --> 01:55:32,339
Yeah.

621
01:55:33,093 --> 01:55:35,710
Don't worry about me, John.

622
01:55:36,763 --> 01:55:38,254
I just gotta catch my breath.

623
01:55:40,725 --> 01:55:42,307
I'll catch up to you, John.

624
01:55:47,732 --> 01:55:48,848
No, you won't.

625
01:56:00,162 --> 01:56:03,496
You gentlemen, of course,
realize that was the first wave.

626
01:56:03,582 --> 01:56:05,244
Merely an amuse-bouche.

627
01:56:06,168 --> 01:56:09,536
We can keep this up as long as you'd like,
but it only ends one way.

628
01:56:09,629 --> 01:56:11,996
Are you sure a protracted war
is the best way forward?

629
01:56:12,090 --> 01:56:14,332
There won't be anything
"protracted" about it.

630
01:56:14,426 --> 01:56:16,779
Oh, you can take the Continental,
I have no doubt about that,

631
01:56:16,803 --> 01:56:19,511
but keeping it,
that's a different matter entirely.

632
01:56:19,598 --> 01:56:22,466
My allegiances run
way beyond this building.

633
01:56:23,560 --> 01:56:24,971
We are High Table.

634
01:56:25,770 --> 01:56:27,011
And we...

635
01:56:28,231 --> 01:56:29,972
are New York City.

636
01:56:31,026 --> 01:56:32,517
Are we negotiating?

637
01:56:34,696 --> 01:56:37,655
Hmm. I believe we are.

638
01:56:43,413 --> 01:56:44,413
Parley?

639
01:56:45,290 --> 01:56:46,656
Parley.

640
01:56:50,253 --> 01:56:52,290
What do you propose we do?

641
01:56:56,593 --> 01:56:58,380
Let me keep my power.

642
01:56:59,095 --> 01:57:00,095
Under the Table.

643
01:57:03,058 --> 01:57:07,553
I have served
and been a beacon of order and stability

644
01:57:07,646 --> 01:57:09,763
to our industry for over 40 years.

645
01:57:09,856 --> 01:57:14,726
Now, I humbly acknowledge I overstepped
and re-pledge my fealty to the High Table.

646
01:57:18,031 --> 01:57:19,112
Winston.

647
01:57:24,829 --> 01:57:28,948
You were merely showing strength
so we would let you keep the Continental.

648
01:57:32,712 --> 01:57:34,920
The High Table accepts your fealty.

649
01:57:36,883 --> 01:57:38,124
But what about him?

650
01:57:40,345 --> 01:57:43,838
What are we going to do about John Wick?

651
01:57:49,479 --> 01:57:50,845
Oh, he has to die.

652
01:57:52,732 --> 01:57:54,564
- Sorry, Jonathan.
- Winston!

653
01:57:54,651 --> 01:57:55,687
Don't see any other way.

654
01:58:07,831 --> 01:58:12,667
Very well, gentlemen.
The Continental will now be reconsecrated.

655
01:58:13,837 --> 01:58:15,044
Good day to you both.

656
01:58:19,718 --> 01:58:21,050
Well played, sir.

657
01:58:56,630 --> 01:58:58,963
How long do you estimate until we reopen?

658
01:58:59,674 --> 01:59:01,256
Oh, should be no time at all.

659
01:59:05,430 --> 01:59:06,796
Mr. Wick is gone.

660
01:59:07,474 --> 01:59:08,760
A true tragedy.

661
01:59:09,184 --> 01:59:12,848
You misunderstand.
I mean that he is no longer on the street.

662
01:59:13,605 --> 01:59:14,641
That seems improbable.

663
01:59:14,731 --> 01:59:16,017
And yet, true.

664
01:59:17,734 --> 01:59:20,226
<i>I trust you understand
the repercussions if he survives.</i>

665
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:22,186
<i>Both from above and below.</i>

666
01:59:22,989 --> 01:59:26,983
The last thing either one of us needs is
Mr. Wick paying us a visit in the night.

667
01:59:29,871 --> 01:59:31,908
For both our sakes,
I'll hope you see to it

668
01:59:31,998 --> 01:59:34,240
that this situation is taken care of, yes?

669
01:59:34,334 --> 01:59:37,918
Absolutely. How far can he get?

670
01:59:49,516 --> 01:59:50,516
Baba Yaga.

671
02:00:22,215 --> 02:00:23,956
How you doing, John?

672
02:00:24,676 --> 02:00:26,918
You look as bad as I feel.

673
02:00:27,971 --> 02:00:31,055
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny.

674
02:00:32,016 --> 02:00:33,882
Raise a hand if you can hear me, John.

675
02:00:37,063 --> 02:00:39,521
Oh, shit. They took a finger.

676
02:00:39,983 --> 02:00:42,976
Ain't that a bitch?

677
02:00:47,949 --> 02:00:51,317
Oh, John fucking Wick.

678
02:00:52,036 --> 02:00:55,620
So, the old boy keeps his hotel
and you take the fall.

679
02:00:56,249 --> 02:00:57,249
Can't say I blame him.

680
02:00:57,333 --> 02:00:59,541
I would've done the same thing
if I was in his shoes.

681
02:01:00,670 --> 02:01:03,287
But this High Table shit...

682
02:01:06,384 --> 02:01:08,091
Seven cuts.

683
02:01:11,639 --> 02:01:14,052
Under the Table is where shit gets done.

684
02:01:16,227 --> 02:01:19,265
And they're about to find out,
if you cut a king,

685
02:01:19,355 --> 02:01:21,017
you better cut him to the quick.

686
02:01:26,237 --> 02:01:27,444
So...

687
02:01:29,991 --> 02:01:31,357
Let me ask you, John.

688
02:01:32,410 --> 02:01:33,410
How do you feel?

689
02:01:36,206 --> 02:01:40,325
'Cause I am really pissed off.

690
02:01:41,294 --> 02:01:45,129
You pissed, John? Hmm? Are you?

691
02:01:55,391 --> 02:01:56,882
Yeah.
