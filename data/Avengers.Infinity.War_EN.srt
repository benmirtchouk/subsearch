184
00:13:02,986 --> 00:13:04,518
It's not overselling it
to say that

185
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,320
the fate of the universe
is at stake.

186
00:13:06,322 --> 00:13:07,857
And who's "we"?

187
00:13:09,425 --> 00:13:10,826
Hey, Tony.

188
00:13:10,828 --> 00:13:11,959

189
00:13:11,961 --> 00:13:13,463

of the universe,

192
00:13:22,205 --> 00:13:24,173

193
00:13:24,474 --> 00:13:26,340

194
00:13:26,342 --> 00:13:29,944

six elemental crystals...

195
00:13:29,946 --> 00:13:32,815
hurtling across
the virgin universe.

196
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,349
These Infinity Stones

197
00:13:35,351 --> 00:13:38,288
each control an essential
aspect of existence.

198
00:13:39,255 --> 00:13:40,390

199
00:13:41,491 --> 00:13:42,825

203
00:13:52,135 --> 00:13:53,336
And Time.

204
00:14:03,011 --> 00:14:04,278
Tell me his name again.

205
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,579
Thanos.

206
00:14:05,581 --> 00:14:07,080
He's a plague, Tony.

207
00:14:07,082 --> 00:14:09,115
He invades planets.
He takes what he wants.

208
00:14:09,117 --> 00:14:11,352
He wipes out
half the population.

209
00:14:11,354 --> 00:14:13,621
He sent Loki.

210
00:14:13,623 --> 00:14:16,559
The attack on New York,
that's him.

211
00:14:17,225 --> 00:14:18,327
This is it.

212
00:14:19,462 --> 00:14:20,428
What's our timeline?

213
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:23,029
No telling. He has
the Power and Space Stones.

214
00:14:23,031 --> 00:14:23,963
That already makes him

215
00:14:23,965 --> 00:14:25,666
the strongest creature
in the whole universe.

216
00:14:25,668 --> 00:14:29,202
If he gets his hands
on all six stones, Tony...

217
00:14:29,204 --> 00:14:30,337
He could destroy life

218
00:14:30,339 --> 00:14:32,506
on a scale
hitherto undreamt of.

219
00:14:32,508 --> 00:14:34,508
Did you seriously just say
"hitherto undreamt of"?

220
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:36,677
Are you seriously leaning
on the Cauldron of the Cosmos?

222

I'm going to allow that.

223
00:14:45,187 --> 00:14:46,620
If Thanos needs all six,
why don't we just

224
00:14:46,622 --> 00:14:48,254
stick this one down
a garbage disposal?

225
00:14:48,256 --> 00:14:49,489
No can do.

226
00:14:49,491 --> 00:14:52,292
We swore an oath to protect
the Time Stone with our lives.

227
00:14:52,294 --> 00:14:53,560
STARK:
And I swore off dairy...

228
00:14:53,562 --> 00:14:56,196
but then Ben & Jerry's named
a flavor after me.

229

Burning Fudge is our favorite.

232

- That's a thing?
- Whatever.

233
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:03,370
Point is, things change.

234
00:15:03,372 --> 00:15:06,473
Our oath to protect
the Time Stone cannot change.

235
00:15:06,475 --> 00:15:08,641
And this stone may be the best
chance we have against Thanos.

236
00:15:08,643 --> 00:15:09,542
Yeah, so conversely,

237
00:15:09,544 --> 00:15:11,678
it may also be
his best chance against us.

238
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,313

The fact is
we have this stone.

244
00:15:24,459 --> 00:15:26,192
We know where it is.

245
00:15:26,194 --> 00:15:28,595
Vision is out there somewhere
with the Mind Stone...

246
00:15:28,597 --> 00:15:30,365

247

249
00:15:33,602 --> 00:15:36,136
Two weeks ago, Vision turned
off his transponder.

250
00:15:36,138 --> 00:15:37,303
He's offline.

251
00:15:37,305 --> 00:15:38,638

- Yeah.

252
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,707
Tony, you lost
another super-bot?

253
00:15:40,709 --> 00:15:43,243
I didn't lose him. He's more
than that. He's evolving.

254

00:31:37,692 --> 00:31:40,225
that he imprisoned in Hel.

535
00:31:40,227 --> 00:31:43,328
And then she returned home
and stabbed me in the eye.

536
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:44,697
So I had to kill her.

537
00:31:44,699 --> 00:31:46,998
That's life though,
isn't it, I guess.

538
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,202
Goes round and round and...

539
00:31:49,069 --> 00:31:50,202
I feel your pain.

540
00:31:50,204 --> 00:31:52,571
I feel your pain as well,
because...

541
00:31:52,573 --> 00:31:53,972
I mean,
it's not a competition,

542
00:31:53,974 --> 00:31:55,207
but I've been through a lot.

543
00:31:55,209 --> 00:31:57,075
- My father killed my mother.
- (SLURPING)

544
00:31:57,077 --> 00:31:58,243
And then I had to kill
my father.

545
00:31:58,245 --> 00:31:59,978
- That was hard.
- (SIGHS)

546
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:03,315
Probably even harder
than having to kill a sister.

547
00:32:03,317 --> 00:32:06,351
Plus, I came out with
both my eyes, which was...

548
00:32:06,353 --> 00:32:08,122
I need a hammer, not a spoon.

549
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:13,492
How do I open this thing?
Is there some sort of, uh...

550
00:32:13,494 --> 00:32:16,194
A four-digit code, maybe?
Maybe a birthdate.

551
00:32:16,196 --> 00:32:19,564
- Uh, what are you doing?
- Taking your pod.

552

(PETER CLEARS THROAT)

553
00:32:21,068 --> 00:32:22,269
(IN DEEP VOICE)
No, you're not.

554
00:32:24,204 --> 00:32:28,507
You will not be taking
our pod today, sir.

555
00:32:28,509 --> 00:32:32,011
Uh... Quill, are you making
your voice deeper?

556
00:32:33,747 --> 00:32:35,580
- No.
- You are.

557
00:32:35,582 --> 00:32:38,483
You're imitating the god-man.
It's weird.

558
00:32:38,485 --> 00:32:39,984
No, I'm not.

559
00:32:39,986 --> 00:32:41,988
- (GASPS) He just did it again!
- This is my voice.

560
00:32:48,127 --> 00:32:49,494
Are you mocking me?

561
00:32:49,496 --> 00:32:53,030
- Are you mocking me?
- Stop it. You did it again.

562
00:32:53,032 --> 00:32:54,098
He's trying to copy me.

563
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,232
I need you to stop doing that.

564
00:32:55,234 --> 00:32:57,067
- GAMORA: Enough!
- He's doing it first.

565
00:32:57,069 --> 00:32:58,503
We need to stop Thanos.

566
00:32:58,505 --> 00:33:00,204
Which means
we need to find out

567
00:33:00,206 --> 00:33:01,339
where he's going next.

568
00:33:01,341 --> 00:33:02,674
Knowhere.

569
00:33:02,676 --> 00:33:04,543
He must be going somewhere.

570
00:33:04,545 --> 00:33:06,678
(IN NORMAL VOICE)
No, no. Knowhere?

571
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,548
It's a place.
We've been there. It sucks.

572
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:12,417
- Excuse me, that's our food.
- Not anymore.

573
00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:15,687
Thor, why would he
go to Knowhere?

574
00:33:15,689 --> 00:33:17,154
THOR: Because for years...

575
00:33:17,156 --> 00:33:19,356
the Reality Stone's been
safely stored there

576
00:33:19,358 --> 00:33:21,025
with a man
called the Collector.

577
00:33:21,027 --> 00:33:22,627
PETER: If it's with the
Collector, then it's not safe.

578
00:33:22,629 --> 00:33:24,529
Only an idiot
would give that man a stone.

579
00:33:24,531 --> 00:33:26,163
- Or a genius.
- GAMORA: How do you know...

580
00:33:26,165 --> 00:33:28,733
he's not going
for one of the other stones?

581
00:33:28,735 --> 00:33:31,368
There are six stones
out there.

582
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:33,672
Thanos already has
the Power Stone...

583
00:33:33,674 --> 00:33:37,475
because he stole it last week
when he decimated Xandar.

584
00:33:37,477 --> 00:33:39,644
He stole the Space Stone
from me...

585
00:33:39,646 --> 00:33:42,513
when he destroyed my ship and
slaughtered half my people.

586
00:33:42,515 --> 00:33:44,281
The Time and Mind Stones
are safe on Earth.

587
00:33:44,283 --> 00:33:45,549
They're with the Avengers.

588
00:33:45,551 --> 00:33:48,085
- The Avengers?
- Earth's mightiest heroes.

589
00:33:48,087 --> 00:33:49,320
Like Kevin Bacon?

590
00:33:49,322 --> 00:33:50,621
He may be on the team.
I don't know.

591
00:33:50,623 --> 00:33:51,689
I haven't been there
in a while.

592
00:33:51,691 --> 00:33:54,258
As for the Soul Stone, well,
no one's ever seen that.

593
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,093
No one even knows where it is.

594
00:33:56,095 --> 00:33:57,762
Therefore Thanos can't get it.

595
00:33:57,764 --> 00:33:59,463
Therefore he's going
to Knowhere.

596
00:33:59,465 --> 00:34:02,132
Hence he'll be getting
the Reality Stone.

597
00:34:02,134 --> 00:34:03,300
You're welcome.

598
00:34:03,302 --> 00:34:04,602
Then we have to go
to Knowhere now.

599
00:34:04,604 --> 00:34:08,706
Wrong. Where we have to go
is Nidavellir.

600
00:34:08,708 --> 00:34:10,708
- That's a made-up word.
- All words are made up.

601
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:14,111
Nidavellir is real? Seriously?

602
00:34:14,113 --> 00:34:15,746
That place is a legend.

603
00:34:15,748 --> 00:34:17,348
They make the most powerful,
horrific weapons

604
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:19,517
(CHUCKLING)
to ever torment the universe.

605
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:21,685
I would very much like
to go there, please.

606
00:34:21,687 --> 00:34:22,753
The rabbit is correct

607
00:34:22,755 --> 00:34:23,854
and clearly the smartest
among you.

608
00:34:23,856 --> 00:34:24,889
Rabbit?

609
00:34:24,891 --> 00:34:27,558
Only Eitri the Dwarf can
make me the weapon I need.

610
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,859
I assume
you're the captain, sir.

611
00:34:28,861 --> 00:34:30,194
You're very perceptive.

612
00:34:30,196 --> 00:34:31,428
You seem like a noble leader.

613
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:33,230
Will you join me
on my quest to Nidavellir?

614
00:34:33,232 --> 00:34:36,200
Let me just ask the captain.
Oh, wait a second, it's me!

615
00:34:36,202 --> 00:34:38,135
- Yeah. I'll go.
- Wonderful!

616
00:34:38,137 --> 00:34:39,303
Uh, except for that
I'm the captain.

617
00:34:39,305 --> 00:34:40,504
THOR: Quiet.

618
00:34:40,506 --> 00:34:42,172
- That's my backpack.
- ROCKET: Go sit down.

619
00:34:42,174 --> 00:34:43,808
PETER: Look, this is my ship.

620
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:46,610
And I'm not goin' to...

621
00:34:46,612 --> 00:34:48,813
Wait, what kinda weapon
are we talkin' about here?

622
00:34:48,815 --> 00:34:50,881
The Thanos-killing kind.

623
00:34:50,883 --> 00:34:52,616
Don't you think that we should
all have a weapon like that?

624
00:34:52,618 --> 00:34:54,785
No. You simply lack
the strength to wield them.

625
00:34:54,787 --> 00:34:56,119
Your bodies would crumble

626
00:34:56,121 --> 00:34:57,388
as your minds collapsed
into madness.

627
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:59,456
Is it weird that I wanna do it
even more now?

628
00:34:59,458 --> 00:35:00,724
Mmm, a little bit, yeah.

629
00:35:00,726 --> 00:35:02,191
If we don't go to Knowhere

630
00:35:02,193 --> 00:35:03,794
and Thanos retrieves
another stone...

631
00:35:03,796 --> 00:35:05,563
he'll be too powerful to stop.

632
00:35:05,565 --> 00:35:07,832
- He already is.
- I got it figured out.

633
00:35:07,834 --> 00:35:09,667
We got two ships

634
00:35:09,669 --> 00:35:11,301
and a large assortment
of morons.

635
00:35:11,303 --> 00:35:14,638
So me and Groot will go
with the pirate angel here.

636
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,840
And the morons
will go to Knowhere

637
00:35:15,842 --> 00:35:17,641
to try to stop Thanos.

638
00:35:17,643 --> 00:35:19,710

- So cool.

I know that
you're going with him

641
00:35:23,281 --> 00:35:24,481
because it's where
Thanos isn't.

642
00:35:24,483 --> 00:35:26,149
You know, you really shouldn't

643
00:35:26,151 --> 00:35:28,253
talk that way
to your captain, Quill.

00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,921

to Glasgow...

I didn't go back?

But you gave Stark your word.

I'd rather give it to you.

expecting me too, you know.

01:01:28,734 --> 01:01:29,801
See him down there?
He's in trouble.

1067
01:01:29,803 --> 01:01:30,868
What's your plan?

1068
01:01:30,870 --> 01:01:32,005
- Go.
- Um...

1069
01:01:32,738 --> 01:01:34,305
Okay, okay... Uh...

1070
01:01:34,307 --> 01:01:37,741
Okay. Did you ever see
this really old movie, <i>Aliens?</i>

1071
01:01:37,743 --> 01:01:39,745
(SCREAMING)

1072
01:01:41,248 --> 01:01:44,149
EBONY MAW:
Painful, aren't they?

1073
01:01:44,151 --> 01:01:47,851
They were originally designed
for microsurgery.

1074
01:01:47,853 --> 01:01:49,922
- And any one of them...
- (THUD)

1075
01:01:54,994 --> 01:01:57,829
could end your friend's life
in an instant.

1076
01:01:57,831 --> 01:01:59,464
IRON MAN: <i>I gotta tell you,
he's not really my friend.</i>

1077
01:01:59,466 --> 01:02:02,202
<i>Saving his life is more
of a professional courtesy.</i>

1078
01:02:04,036 --> 01:02:06,737
You've saved nothing.

1079
01:02:06,739 --> 01:02:08,806
Your powers
are inconsequential

1080
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:10,308
compared to mine.

1081
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:12,011
Yeah, but the kid's
seen more movies.

1082
01:02:15,482 --> 01:02:16,682

1083
01:02:17,249 --> 01:02:18,851

01:02:22,021 --> 01:02:23,255
(GRUNTS)

1085
01:02:26,158 --> 01:02:28,294
SPIDER-MAN: Yes! Wait.
What are those?

1086
01:02:31,130 --> 01:02:32,798
(YELLING)

1087
01:02:38,337 --> 01:02:39,471
(GRUNTS)

1088
01:02:44,009 --> 01:02:45,778
SPIDER-MAN: Hey,
we haven't officially met.

1089
01:02:47,012 --> 01:02:48,080
Cool.

1090
01:02:50,082 --> 01:02:51,548
We gotta turn
this ship around.

1091
01:02:51,550 --> 01:02:53,917
STARK: Yeah, now he wants
to run. Great plan.

1092
01:02:53,919 --> 01:02:55,352
No, I want to protect
the stone.

1093
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:56,787
STARK: And I want you
to thank me.

1094
01:02:56,789 --> 01:02:58,322
Now, go ahead. I'm listening.

1095
01:02:58,324 --> 01:03:01,225
DR. STRANGE: For what?
Nearly blasting me into space?

1096
01:03:01,227 --> 01:03:03,560
Who just saved
your magical ass? Me.

1097
01:03:03,562 --> 01:03:04,428
I seriously don't know

1098
01:03:04,430 --> 01:03:05,596
how you fit your head
into that helmet.

1099
01:03:05,598 --> 01:03:08,432
Admit it, you should've
ducked out when I told you to.

1100
01:03:08,434 --> 01:03:10,167
I tried to bench you.
You refused.

1101
01:03:10,169 --> 01:03:12,236
Unlike everyone else in your
life, I don't work for you.

1102
01:03:12,238 --> 01:03:13,971
And due to that fact,

1103
01:03:13,973 --> 01:03:15,372
we're now
in a flying doughnut...

1104
01:03:15,374 --> 01:03:17,241
billions of miles from Earth
with no backup.

1105
01:03:17,243 --> 01:03:19,309
- I'm backup.
- No, you're a stowaway.

1106
01:03:19,311 --> 01:03:20,377
The adults are talking.

1107
01:03:20,379 --> 01:03:23,247
I'm sorry, I'm confused
as to the relationship here.

1108
01:03:23,249 --> 01:03:25,082
What is he, your ward?

1109
01:03:25,084 --> 01:03:26,483
No.

1110
01:03:26,485 --> 01:03:28,518
- I'm Peter, by the way.
- Doctor Strange.

1111
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:30,289
Oh, you're using
our made-up names. Um...

1112
01:03:31,257 --> 01:03:33,390
I'm Spider-Man, then.

1113
01:03:33,392 --> 01:03:35,058
This ship is
self-correcting its course.

1114
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:36,193
Thing's on autopilot.

1115
01:03:36,195 --> 01:03:38,095
DR. STRANGE:
Can we control it?

1116
01:03:38,097 --> 01:03:40,032
Fly us home?

1117
01:03:43,035 --> 01:03:44,167
- Stark?
- Yeah.

1118
01:03:44,169 --> 01:03:45,502
Can you get us home?

1119
01:03:45,504 --> 01:03:46,904
Yeah, I heard you.

1120
01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:50,509
I'm thinking I'm not
so sure we should.

1121
01:03:51,243 --> 01:03:52,908
Under no circumstances

1122
01:03:52,910 --> 01:03:55,479
can we bring
the Time Stone to Thanos.

1123
01:03:55,481 --> 01:03:56,879
I don't think
you quite understand

1124
01:03:56,881 --> 01:03:57,814
what's at stake here.

1125
01:03:57,816 --> 01:04:00,417
What? No. It's you
who doesn't understand...

1126
01:04:00,419 --> 01:04:03,353
that Thanos has been
inside my head for six years.

1127
01:04:03,355 --> 01:04:05,087
Since he sent an army
to New York

1128
01:04:05,089 --> 01:04:06,856
and now he's back.

1129
01:04:06,858 --> 01:04:08,924
And I don't know what to do.

1130
01:04:08,926 --> 01:04:10,059
So I'm not so sure

1131
01:04:10,061 --> 01:04:12,094
if it's a better plan to fight
him on our turf or his...

1132
01:04:12,096 --> 01:04:15,931
but you saw what they did,
what they can do.

1133
01:04:15,933 --> 01:04:18,234
At least on his turf,
he's not expecting it.

1134
01:04:18,236 --> 01:04:21,170
So I say we take
the fight to him.

1135
01:04:21,172 --> 01:04:22,173
Doctor.

1136
01:04:23,941 --> 01:04:25,477
Do you concur?

1137
01:04:28,046 --> 01:04:30,516
All right, Stark.
We go to him.

1138
01:04:31,583 --> 01:04:33,949
But you have to understand...

1139
01:04:33,951 --> 01:04:35,552
if it comes to saving you

1140
01:04:35,554 --> 01:04:38,254
or the kid
or the Time Stone...

1141
01:04:38,256 --> 01:04:41,991
I will not hesitate
to let either of you die.

1142
01:04:41,993 --> 01:04:46,195
I can't, because the universe
depends on it.

1143
01:04:46,197 --> 01:04:49,100
Nice. Good, moral compass.
(PATS ARM)

1144
01:04:50,335 --> 01:04:51,936

1145
01:04:53,037 --> 01:04:54,439
(SIGHS) All right, kid.

1146
01:04:55,674 --> 01:04:56,908
You're an Avenger now.

1147
01:05:33,378 --> 01:05:35,613
THANOS: I thought
you might be hungry.

1148
01:05:47,725 --> 01:05:49,525
I always hated that chair.

1149
01:05:49,527 --> 01:05:52,294
THANOS: So I've been told.

1150
01:05:52,296 --> 01:05:56,234
Even so, I'd hoped you'd
sit in it one day.

1151
01:05:57,033 --> 01:05:58,469
I hated this room.

1152
01:05:59,370 --> 01:06:00,736
This ship.

1153
01:06:00,738 --> 01:06:02,573
I hated my life.

1154
01:06:07,110 --> 01:06:09,313
THANOS: You told me that too.

1155
01:06:12,450 --> 01:06:13,950
Every day.

1156
01:06:16,587 --> 01:06:18,556
For almost 20 years.

1157
01:06:21,191 --> 01:06:23,528
I was a child
when you took me.

1158
01:06:24,429 --> 01:06:25,696
I saved you.

1159
01:06:29,299 --> 01:06:30,299
No.

1160
01:06:31,702 --> 01:06:35,471
No. We were happy
on my home planet.

1161
01:06:35,473 --> 01:06:37,205
Going to bed hungry...

1162
01:06:37,207 --> 01:06:39,107
scrounging for scraps.

1163
01:06:39,109 --> 01:06:42,076
Your planet was
on the brink of collapse.

1164
01:06:42,078 --> 01:06:44,513
I'm the one who stopped that.

1165
01:06:44,515 --> 01:06:46,515
Do you know
what's happened since then?

1166
01:06:46,517 --> 01:06:48,717
The children born...

1167
01:06:48,719 --> 01:06:52,353
have known nothing but
full bellies and clear skies.

1168
01:06:52,355 --> 01:06:53,558
It's a paradise.

1169
01:06:56,293 --> 01:06:58,326
Because you murdered
half the planet.

1170
01:06:58,328 --> 01:07:01,362
A small price to pay
for salvation.

1171
01:07:01,364 --> 01:07:02,497
You're insane.

1172
01:07:02,499 --> 01:07:04,599
Little one,
it's a simple calculus.

1173
01:07:04,601 --> 01:07:08,069
This universe is finite,
its resources finite.

1174
01:07:08,071 --> 01:07:12,407
If life is left unchecked,
life will cease to exist.

1175
01:07:12,409 --> 01:07:13,608
It needs correction.

1176
01:07:13,610 --> 01:07:15,111
You don't know that!

1177
01:07:16,546 --> 01:07:19,414
I'm the only one
who knows that.

1178
01:07:19,416 --> 01:07:23,587
At least, I'm the only one
with the will to act on it.

1179
01:07:25,255 --> 01:07:26,256
For a time...

1180
01:07:28,725 --> 01:07:33,129
you had that same will...

1181
01:07:34,598 --> 01:07:37,133
as you fought by my side.

1182
01:07:37,835 --> 01:07:39,069
Daughter.

1183
01:07:39,703 --> 01:07:41,538
I'm not your daughter.

1184
01:07:44,074 --> 01:07:46,676
Everything I hate about myself
you taught me.

1185
01:07:47,511 --> 01:07:49,110
And, in doing so,

1186
01:07:49,112 --> 01:07:51,314
made you the fiercest woman
in the galaxy.

1187
01:07:54,251 --> 01:07:57,120
That's why I trusted you
to find the Soul Stone.

1188
01:08:00,423 --> 01:08:03,291
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

1189
01:08:03,293 --> 01:08:04,425
(THANOS SIGHS)

1190
01:08:04,427 --> 01:08:07,094
I am disappointed.

1191
01:08:07,096 --> 01:08:09,466
But not because
you didn't find it.

1192
01:08:13,236 --> 01:08:14,738
But because you did.

1193
01:08:16,306 --> 01:08:18,107
And you lied.

1194
01:08:35,190 --> 01:08:36,292
GAMORA: Nebula.

1195
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:44,899
Don't do this.

1196
01:08:44,901 --> 01:08:46,333
THANOS: Some time ago,

1197
01:08:46,335 --> 01:08:49,236
your sister snuck aboard
this ship to kill me.

1198
01:08:49,238 --> 01:08:50,304
Please don't do this.

1199
01:08:50,306 --> 01:08:52,542
THANOS:
And very nearly succeeded.

1200
01:08:53,275 --> 01:08:54,644
So I brought her here.

1201
01:08:56,278 --> 01:08:57,479
To talk.

1202

1203
01:09:05,187 --> 01:09:07,523
Stop. Stop it.

1204
01:09:13,429 --> 01:09:16,296
I swear to you on my life.

1205
01:09:16,298 --> 01:09:18,534
I never found the Soul Stone.

1206
01:09:22,638 --> 01:09:24,438
NEBULA:
<i>Accessing memory files.</i>

1207
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:25,841
<i>You know
what he's about to do.</i>

1208
01:09:25,843 --> 01:09:28,642
<i>He's finally ready,
and he's going for the stones.</i>

1209
01:09:28,644 --> 01:09:29,845
<i>- All of them.
- He can never get them all.</i>

1210
01:09:29,847 --> 01:09:30,912
NEBULA: <i>He will!</i>

1211
01:09:30,914 --> 01:09:33,213
<i>He can't, Nebula.</i>

1212
01:09:33,215 --> 01:09:35,616
<i>Because I found the map
to the Soul Stone...</i>

1213
01:09:35,618 --> 01:09:38,454
<i>and I burned it to ash.
I burned it.</i>

1214
01:09:43,492 --> 01:09:45,327
You're strong.

1215
01:09:47,363 --> 01:09:48,364
Me.

1216
01:09:50,834 --> 01:09:52,501
You're generous.

1217
01:09:53,769 --> 01:09:54,770
Me.

1218
01:09:56,772 --> 01:09:59,439
But I never taught you to lie.

1219
01:09:59,441 --> 01:10:02,144
That's why
you're so bad at it.

1220
01:10:04,313 --> 01:10:08,751

What's there to see?

01:10:58,701 --> 01:11:00,967
What's a twig? Everybody's
seen a twig before.

You speak Groot?

01:11:06,407 --> 01:11:08,575
Yes, they taught it on Asgard.
It was an elective.

1236

I am Groot.

1244

Yeah, that could be annoying.

1245
01:11:41,810 --> 01:11:43,711
Well, he's been dead before.

1246

it really might be true.

your sister and your dad?

Absolutely.

we're talkin' about...

1260

- Well, he's never fought me.
- Yeah, he has.

don't forget.

And every one of them
would've rather killed me,

but none succeeded.

1270
01:12:44,639 --> 01:12:47,706
I'm only alive
because fate wants me alive.

1271

Thanos is just the latest
in a long line of bastards...

1272
01:12:50,678 --> 01:12:52,711
and he'll be the latest
to feel my vengeance.

No, he gave me 100 credits.

1289

that night and stole his eye.

good-looking, needed saving.

1412
01:21:01,898 --> 01:21:03,434
Where is he now?

1413
01:21:18,482 --> 01:21:20,516
This is the plan? We're gonna
hit him with a brick?

1414
01:21:20,518 --> 01:21:21,885
It's a mold.

1415
01:21:22,486 --> 01:21:24,452
A king's weapon.

1416
01:21:24,454 --> 01:21:27,422
Meant to be
the greatest in Asgard.

1417
01:21:27,424 --> 01:21:30,458
In theory, it could even
summon the Bifrost.

1418
01:21:30,460 --> 01:21:32,028
Did it have a name?

1419
01:21:33,229 --> 01:21:34,929
Stormbreaker.

1420
01:21:34,931 --> 01:21:36,032
That's a bit much.

1421
01:21:38,068 --> 01:21:39,135
So how do we make it?

1422
01:21:41,004 --> 01:21:43,173
You'll have to restart
the forge.

1423
01:21:44,140 --> 01:21:46,309
Awaken the heart
of a dying star.

1424
01:21:49,012 --> 01:21:51,514
Rabbit, fire up the pod.

1425
01:21:55,251 --> 01:21:57,352
PETER: The hell happened
to this planet?

1426
01:21:57,354 --> 01:21:59,253
It's eight degrees
off its axis.

1427
01:21:59,255 --> 01:22:01,424
Gravitational pull
is all over the place.

1428
01:22:02,692 --> 01:22:06,494
Yeah, we got one advantage.
He's coming to us.

1429
01:22:06,496 --> 01:22:09,330
We'll use it.
All right, I have a plan.

1430
01:22:09,332 --> 01:22:10,665
Or at least
the beginnings of one.

1431
01:22:10,667 --> 01:22:12,200
It's pretty simple.
We draw him in,

1432
01:22:12,202 --> 01:22:13,501
pin him down,
get what we need.

1433
01:22:13,503 --> 01:22:15,303
Definitely don't wanna
dance with this guy.

1434
01:22:15,305 --> 01:22:17,004
We just want the gauntlet.

1435
01:22:17,006 --> 01:22:19,374
- Are you yawning?
- (YAWNING)

1436
01:22:19,376 --> 01:22:21,642
In the middle of this, while
I'm breaking it down? Huh?

1437
01:22:21,644 --> 01:22:23,478
Did you hear what I said?

1438
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:26,013
I stopped listening after
you said, "We need a plan."

1439
01:22:26,015 --> 01:22:27,081
Okay, Mr. Clean
is on his own page.

1440
01:22:27,083 --> 01:22:30,218
See, "not winging it"
isn't really what they do.

1441
01:22:30,220 --> 01:22:31,952
Uh, what exactly
is it that they do?

1442
01:22:31,954 --> 01:22:33,554
Kick names, take ass.

1443
01:22:33,556 --> 01:22:34,957
Yeah, that's right.

(SIGHS)

1445
01:22:41,531 --> 01:22:43,331
All right, just get over here,
please.

1446
01:22:43,333 --> 01:22:45,400
Mr. Lord, can you get
your folks to circle up?

1447
01:22:45,402 --> 01:22:47,537
"Mr. Lord." Star-Lord is fine.

1448
01:22:50,306 --> 01:22:51,672
STARK: We gotta coalesce.

1449
01:22:51,674 --> 01:22:53,508
'Cause if all we come at him
with is a plucky attitude...

1450
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:56,076
Dude, don't call us plucky.

1451
01:22:56,078 --> 01:22:57,545
We don't know what it means.

1452
01:22:57,547 --> 01:23:00,348
All right, we're optimistic,
yes. I like your plan.

1453
01:23:00,350 --> 01:23:03,049
Except it sucks,
so let me do the plan...

1454
01:23:03,051 --> 01:23:05,118
and that way
it might be really good.

1455
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:07,220
Tell him about the dance-off
to save the universe.

1456
01:23:07,222 --> 01:23:09,457
- STARK: What dance-off?
- (STAMMERS) It's nothing.

1457
01:23:09,459 --> 01:23:10,625
Like in <i>Footloose,</i> the movie?

1458
01:23:10,627 --> 01:23:12,560
Exactly like <i>Footloose.</i>

1459
01:23:12,562 --> 01:23:14,294
Is it still the greatest movie
in history?

1460
01:23:14,296 --> 01:23:15,530
SPIDER-MAN: It never was.

1461
01:23:15,532 --> 01:23:16,631
STARK: Don't encourage this,
all right?

1462
01:23:16,633 --> 01:23:18,131
- Okay.
- We're getting no help

1463
01:23:18,133 --> 01:23:19,667
- from Flash Gordon here.
- Flash Gordon?

1464
01:23:19,669 --> 01:23:21,436
By the way,
that's a compliment.

1465
01:23:21,438 --> 01:23:23,170
Don't forget, I'm half human.

1466
01:23:23,172 --> 01:23:24,607
So that 50% of me
that's stupid...

1467
01:23:25,775 --> 01:23:27,107
that's 100% you.

1468
01:23:27,109 --> 01:23:28,375
STARK: Your math
is blowing my mind.

1469
01:23:28,377 --> 01:23:29,612
MANTIS: Excuse me.

1470
01:23:30,613 --> 01:23:34,149
But does your friend
often do that?

1471
01:23:35,484 --> 01:23:37,720
Strange, we all right?

01:23:48,163 --> 01:23:49,262
You're back. You're all right.

1475
01:23:49,264 --> 01:23:51,498
- DR. STRANGE: Hi.
- Hey, what was that?

1476
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:56,136
I went forward in time
to view alternate futures.

1477
01:23:56,138 --> 01:23:57,637
To see all
the possible outcomes

1478
01:23:57,639 --> 01:23:59,508
of the coming conflict.

1479
01:24:00,309 --> 01:24:01,708
How many did you see?

1480
01:24:01,710 --> 01:24:04,112
14,000,605.

1481
01:24:05,647 --> 01:24:07,182
How many did we win?

1482
01:24:11,787 --> 01:24:13,121
One.

1483
01:24:34,844 --> 01:24:38,046
THANOS: The stone
had better be up there.

1484
01:24:39,748 --> 01:24:41,783
For your sister's sake.

1485
01:25:02,704 --> 01:25:07,509
Welcome, Thanos, son of Alars.

1486
01:25:09,578 --> 01:25:13,112
Gamora, daughter of Thanos.

1487
01:25:13,114 --> 01:25:14,381
THANOS: You know us?

1488
01:25:14,383 --> 01:25:19,419
It is my curse to know all
who journey here.

1489
01:25:19,421 --> 01:25:21,155
Where is the Soul Stone?

1490
01:25:21,723 --> 01:25:24,189
You should know...

1491
01:25:24,191 --> 01:25:27,295
it extracts a terrible price.

1492
01:25:28,564 --> 01:25:30,231
I am prepared.

1493
01:25:32,601 --> 01:25:35,136
We all think that at first.

1494
01:25:39,575 --> 01:25:41,811
We are all wrong.

1495
01:25:53,487 --> 01:25:55,889
THANOS: How is it you know
this place so well?

1496
01:25:55,891 --> 01:26:00,727
A lifetime ago,
I, too, sought the stones.

1497
01:26:00,729 --> 01:26:03,629
I even held one in my hand.

1498
01:26:03,631 --> 01:26:07,802
But it cast me out,
banished me here.

1499
01:26:07,804 --> 01:26:11,841
Guiding others to a treasure
I cannot possess.

1500
01:26:20,615 --> 01:26:23,551
What you seek
lies in front of you.

1501
01:26:24,518 --> 01:26:26,621
As does what you fear.

1502
01:26:27,421 --> 01:26:29,388
What's this?

1503
01:26:29,390 --> 01:26:30,957
RED SKULL: The price.

1504
01:26:30,959 --> 01:26:36,662
Soul holds a special place
among the Infinity Stones.

1505
01:26:36,664 --> 01:26:40,735
You might say it has
a certain wisdom.

1506
01:26:42,236 --> 01:26:44,236
THANOS: Tell me what it needs.

1507
01:26:44,238 --> 01:26:47,807
RED SKULL: To ensure that
whoever possesses it...

1508
01:26:47,809 --> 01:26:50,444
understands its power...

1509
01:26:51,412 --> 01:26:55,347
the stone demands a sacrifice.

1510
01:26:55,349 --> 01:26:57,316
Of what?

1511
01:26:57,318 --> 01:26:59,351
In order to take the stone,

1512
01:26:59,353 --> 01:27:01,689
you must lose
that which you love.

1513
01:27:04,625 --> 01:27:05,860
A soul...

1514
01:27:06,594 --> 01:27:07,795
for a soul.

a moment...

1518
01:27:29,583 --> 01:27:31,652
when you got
what you deserved.

1519
01:27:33,822 --> 01:27:36,256
And I was always
so disappointed.

1520
01:27:39,727 --> 01:27:41,294
But now...

1521
01:27:45,265 --> 01:27:48,334
You kill and torture...

1522
01:27:50,303 --> 01:27:52,305
and you call it mercy.

1523
01:27:56,376 --> 01:27:58,445
The universe has judged you.

1524
01:27:59,914 --> 01:28:04,484
You asked it for a prize,
and it told you no.

1525
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:07,520
You failed.

1526
01:28:08,824 --> 01:28:10,725
And do you wanna know why?

1527
01:28:11,691 --> 01:28:13,560
Because you love nothing.

1528
01:28:14,327 --> 01:28:15,831
No one.

This isn't love.

01:28:52,499 --> 01:28:55,034

1536
01:28:57,604 --> 01:28:59,739
